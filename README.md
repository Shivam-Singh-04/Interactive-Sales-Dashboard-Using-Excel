# Interactive-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Excel
The **objective** was to create an annual sales report of a Super Store for last year. So that, the owner can understand their customers and **grow more sales** in the next year.

We had to create a dashboard to provide the following KPI's as per demand:
1) Compare Sales and Orders using a single chart
2) Which month got the highest sales and orders?
3) Who purchased more- Men or Women?
4) What are the different order status?
5) List top 10 states contributing to the sales.
6) Relation between Age and Gender based on numbers of orders.
7) Which channel is contribnuting to maximum sales?
8) Highest selling category?

After understanding the objective and the problem statement, we went forward to our first step i.e. **Data Cleaning**. For data cleaning we followed the following steps:

**1) Removing Duplicates:** We had to remove duplicates so that they don't cause any error in the calculations or the result outcomes. The easist but less reliable way to remove duplicates is to select all data and click remove duplicates. Or the other way is to apply filters and check for duplicate values and delete them.
**2) Removing Null Values:** The null values has to be removed for the same reason as stated above that they should not cause any error in the Pivot Table calculations. To do so, we apply the filters, select rows with blank values and delete them.
**3) Setting datatype:** Setting the correct datatype is a must.
